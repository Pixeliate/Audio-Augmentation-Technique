# Audio-Augmentation-Technique
Here I will be mentioning different Audio augmentation technique like tempo perturbation, spec augmentation, speed perturbation and so on.
Making it simple in such a way that no pre-processing is required and just the path of folder containg audio with required parameter need to be edited in the script, which is clearly directed in script.

2. Open the script in text-editor and any suitable application. 
3. Change the parameters mention in the code. 
4. open the terminal at came location where script is stored.
